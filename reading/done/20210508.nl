Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate <scramble> to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!

Chandler: It's just that I'm <sick of> being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.

SREs tend to be <incline>d to focus on production problems rather than business logic problems, but as their approach brings software engineering tools to bear on the problem, they share skill sets with product development teams.

and it would be naive to assume that the <efficacy> of SRE in the Google context has nothing to do with the widely accessible unified codebase,

For example, it is not <prescriptive> around the precise management of services.

SRE, on the other hand, has relatively narrowly defined responsibilities and its <remit> is generally service-oriented (and end-user-oriented) rather than whole-business-oriented.

A system with early SRE <engagement> (ideally, at design time) typically works better in production after deployment, regardless of who is responsible for managing the service.

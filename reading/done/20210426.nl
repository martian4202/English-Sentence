Monica: (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your <grilled> cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.

Chandler: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part <vividly>--a <mouthful> of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

Chandler: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it <in reverse>.

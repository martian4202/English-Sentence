you start to really care about someone 
wouldn't be fair
Yeah, who wants fair
Remember when we went to central
he can row like a Viking.
you had a rough day, ha?
If I were omnipotent for day
If I had a wish
I wish for three more wishes
then I get no reason to live
would you look at her
they're both kind of insecure in bed
Well, if you want, 
less than 100 hundred steps from our place to here
tonight at the garden
It's funny
I was hoping you wouldn't remember
or  the good costumes are gone?
You know what? I
I think I'm just gonna go 
what do you say, big guy
maybe it would take my mind off it
I remember the day I got my first paycheck
you worked in a mine?
isn't this exciting
why's he getting all my money
I mean, what?
you look like you're in a play
I'm a duplex
guess who my dad's making partner in his firm
while we're on the subject of news
I have elbows
We'll take a brief timeout
Messiers stops and looks at some women's shoes
the night that we first â€¦ 
could've been a peach
hey, that women's got an ass like Carol's
I though we're trying find stuff
Tell me all the dirt
lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookei
your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies
well it's rum and
we though since phoebe's staying over today
we'd have kind of like a slumber party thing
It's the Visa-card people
Could you please tell me what it is in reference to
they say there's been some unusual activies
everyone I know is either getting married or getting pregnent
actually, I was just saying it looks like
Now that you mention it, there was ice there that night
It was the first frost
Jack from downstairs?
and then he waked up and there was this big plant outside of the window, full of possibilities and stuff
now everything is just kind of like  
I mean, you just gonna figure, at some point, it all gonna come togather and it's just gonna be unflupied
you're not laughing now, are you, pal?
A bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks
he's open
hey, look, we're on the tv thing
to call this number if you are not completely satisfied with this candy bar
or we'd been in the predicatment room
but I'm in a lot of pain
well, you have to wait your return
I didnt' mean to bring down 
Pizza Guy
I don't even hava a 'pla;
we ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese
oh my dad's just gonna kill me
I must give him yours

pretty much sure it's just a towel
so do you want me to take this bakc
hello, who are we spying on
Cliton's campain guy
the one with great hair, the sexy smile, really cute butt
Oh, him, the little guy 
I know we both said somehtings
that doesn't mean we still don't love each other
I feel like I've lost her
Lights still out?
I think he's shy
I think I have to draw him out
he's right, enough already
I think there is a man on the 12th floor in a come who didn't quite hear you
Hockey was a big mistake
there's a whole bunch of stuff we could've done
well, unless goose is vegetable
Then I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurly
the valentine
at least big girl don't pee in their pants in seventh grade
where we've been looking all night
the guy's a freak
That's attractive
Oh, come on, admit it. all things considered, you had fun tonight
where is my puck
you gotta do it man,
Oh yeah. I'm rubber and you are glue
Could've played Monopoly, but
I haven't been using it much
You're just reaching, and there's one little maneuver
A bra, right out the sleeve
As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even come close
come on, you guys can pee standing up
you know what blows my mind?
okay! you knwo what I don't get the way guys can do so many mean thing and they not even care
you just gotta do it
you're sitting there with her. she has no idea what's happening. Finally, you get up the courage to do it
In this horrible awkward moment, you've handed her the note
If you want, I'll do it with you
he is sweet, but it's just not fun any more
last week you had a wonderful nutty, chocolatey, kind of a cakey pie thing 
he wants to give me a Mercedes cities convertible
woo, I hate when my father calls me that
did it give that whole, you are not up to this thing again 
I actually get this extended disco version with three courses of you'll never make it on you own. 
being dumped by obviously agrees with her
one misissipi
you wanna hear a freakish coincidence, guess who's doing laundry there too
was that not clear?
why don't I just join you, both, there
Don't you have a laundry room in your building
there's a rat problem
they're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy
anyway, say 7-ish
Forget joey, I'm with bob now
you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor 
come on, we were great together
I'm asking a favour here
I'm thinking if I do this thing for his brother
you go out with tons of girls
monika is not coming, so it's gonna be me with Rachel
you sure you've thought this through
so what are you saying here
I should shave gain? pick up some wine, what
It says I'm sensitive, warm, kind a guyt
like a little fuzzy bear
alright. Let's pick something else up on the way
I'll be shutting up now
rent a car, run over some puppies
we got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with little vegetables
anyway, they pretty much sucks

so, I blew up. the rest of afternoon I went shopping. And I got you 
What did you get me there?
I figure you know you could wear a bullwinkles and a bullwinkles
or you can mix and match
whatever you want
well, I'm gonna get another espresso, well, more latte?
I'm still working on mine?
Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal
ok, you weren't there
I was kind of using that machine
Yeah, well now you're kind of not
Is that you basket
no suds, no save
horrible woman just took my machine
her stuff wasn't in it 
Nothing to see here
I can't even send back soup 
It's new, It's German, It's extra tough
I being like a total laundry spaz
am I supposed to use one machine for one machien for shoes and another machine for pants
Well, not my self
ok, you caught me, I'm a laundry virgin
I'll use the gentle cycle
A whole other machine for your colours
and a third for your delicates 
what about these are white cotton panties
would they go whites or delicates
so where did you guys go up
But I'm not 
the cute nibblely noise she make when she eats
So it's not gonna last
I've gotta tell you
Yeah, isn't he?
He's so great, to meet a guy, who's smart and funny has a emotional age beyond like 8
my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity
it's just like pulling off a band-aid, just do it really fast and then the wound just exposed
well, there you go
stop it, stop it, stop it 
I know it's gonna sound really stupid
There isn't anything I can't do 
That does not sound stupid
it's like the first time I'd to make dinner for myself after Carol left me Next on Ross
What's the matter, Come on ,show me
it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, evething's kind of pink
except the red sock, which is still red
God! I'm gonna look like marshmallow peeps
something went wrong with underdog, that he couldn't get his head to inflate 
so anyway his head is like flopping down broadway, right. r and I'm just thinking how inappropriate this is  
I have something in my eye, Joey, could we check in the light
Hello? were we at the same table ,that's like cocktails in Appalachia
Come on, they're close
like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross
I'm not proud of this, ok?
maybe I'm a little
I'm out of here
You like him, I want her, he likes you
I'm thinking if we put our head together between the tww? of us, we can break them up
I just couldn't stop laughing at you Norman Mailer story
Here is the things, Janice
You know  I mean it is likew e are different
I'll be right back
It's the worst break-up in the history of the world
I'm not fun, here she comes, she comes
we should always always break up together
I guess, except everything looks like jammies
Yes, well, I had a twenty-four-inch waist, you lose things
get out of my way
maybe I wasn't being clear, this was our cart
there weren't any clothes in it
Quit making up rules
you were incredible
A brand-new woman, ladies and gentleman
Does it still hurt 
What a neat idea, all your clothes match
we ripped that couple apart, and kept pieces for ourselves
he need some time to grieve
I'm free
That ought to do it
you can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays befores
Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom
the exclamation point int the title scares me 
you know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud
Well, Eva. We've done some excellent work here
Your problem is quite clear
I feel violated
did anyone else feel like just want to peel the skin off theirbody
Ross ten o'clock
Is it. It feels like two
like short, fat, bald man
and what would my opening line be?
could she be more out of my league
Ross, back me up here.
with these nothing guys
I can't believe I'm even considering this
I'm very very aware of my tongue
it wasn't that bad I was the lead
was that better that the thging I did in the trolls
you got to see my head 
I think I like it better that way
The usher give me this to give to you 
Based on this play?
this line is passion
I can't believe I;ve been here for more seven seconds you haven't ask me how my date went 
Luck we know none of the bullets hit the engine block
I've been talking about myself all night long
and I rode it all the way to Brooklyne, just for the hell of it
We talked till 2 It was this perfect evening more or less 
Tell me how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me

sliding your foot so far up my leg like you can count the change in my pokect 

So explain something to me here, what kind of relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend
I suppose mainly sexual
what now work out?
Did you listen to the story
I mean this is  twisted
I had some trouble with that at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff. All the fun, all the taling, all the sex and none of responsibility, and this is every guy's fantacy 
Look! I cleaned
I did windows and I did floors
I've used all the attachments in the vacuum, except little round one, because I don't knwo what that for 
nobody knows, we're not supposed to ask
there's an extra seat around the coffee table 
let's see what it looks like in the old spot
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman   
I mean she'll scratch your eye right out
Remember when I lived with you
Come on, when we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll, wasn't it ragged
All right, you, madcap gal
try to imagine this, the phone bill arrives, but you dont' pay it right away. Instead, you wait until they send you a notice
You let me go grocery shopping  and I buy laundry detergents, but it's not the one with easy pour spout
one might wonder
someone left a glass on the coffee table, there's no coaster, it's a cold drink, it's a hot day, little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood
that was my agent
I'm out of order, petrer?
This whole courtrooms are out of order
so you're gonna invite us all to the big opening 
I need to borrow some moisturizers
Joey's mom is on the phone
Hey listen,  Can I borrow a couple of things, Aurora spent the night
oh, you got the whole nigh
I only have 20 minutes until Ethen
you know how in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you would remember for the rest of your life 
Every single second it's like with Aurora
And I've just wasted about 35 of them talking you people
ok, everybody I would like to get this in one take
please, let's roll it
I think his butt would like to get he shot before lunck
But actually, I mean my finguers
I know there will be many moments in years to come when I'll regret asking the following the question
what you are saying is you are not completely fu
why can't we just have what we have now
without feeling obligated to one another
up untill together I though that's what you wanted toop
part of me wants that 
it's like I'm two guus
actually it's the guy who wells up every time the Grinch's heart grow three 
You know, I have to listen to the both of them
They don't exactly let each other finish
call me if you change your mind
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips
look at it this way
intelligent, unattainable
Tell me why you do this agian
It feels like a big guy moment
Now everyone's gonna go to theatre expecting see me
something so sweet
I did nothing but crappy plays for six years
I'm gonna go to bed guys
reckless,
I'll get them tomorrow, or night
Central Perk
Oh, that had to hurt
Yeah, like that htough never entered my mind
that's my sister
my wiredest place would have to be the women's room on the new york city's public library
the ride broke down 
So Carol and I went behind a couple of those Mechanic Dutch chilren
they fixed the  ride
We were asked never to return to the Magic Kindom
the foot of the bed
where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of the theme park
It was the only thing to do there, that didn't have a line 
Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature-golf course
You know, I'll tell you something
Passion is way overated
It is uh... eventually kind of burns out
hopefully, what you left with is trust, security
there's all that other good stuff
It's never going to happend
you waited too long to make you move 
You're the mayor of the zone
what are we shushing
we are shushing ,becaus we are trying to hear somehting
don't you hear that
do you want my help
he's planning your birthday party
and you'd better act surprised
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacoke at the zoo
actually, not so much a question
all for a while, I've been wanting to 
look at that little cat
Sorry that was wax
why don't we just put this poor little tootie out in the hall
She'll get trampled
Could'be said gum would be nice, could've said I'll have a stick
I loathe myself
they hate all living things, right?
come on, lucky sixes
and Rachel keeps touch him
Blow a bubble
it's got a boyish charm, it's impish
nice going imp
all I need to do is reach over and put it back in my mouth
This is so un-me
The first time he smilled at me, those three seconds is 
oh, it's not about that right now
you get to whip it
This isn't the best time to bring it up 
Does it get better than this
Because I met somebody who would be perfect froy ou 
Do you want a date Saturday
It's because I kind of wanted to go out with her t oo
I told her, actually, you were seeing Bellrn spellman, who also liked her 
Ross is smart and funny 
You ever think that about him
what is it 
Because I was worrried you guys would be vague about that
It's Paolo calling from ROme
Your dad just beeped in \
what's with your hair
Can we still have boyfriends and your career to cover
the fuzzy little mints, at the bottom of her purse
Yeah, they were gross
you know what I love Her sweet'n knows
how she was always stealing them from restaraunts
So did she?
whenever I use one of those littel yellow pencils
you are worm food
So chandler looks gay, huh
Oh, that doesn't mean she can't look nice
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
I don't see why not
and then we throw your body in the water
That's probably what they'll say
Apparently, other people makes the same mistake
That's who you saw me with?
He's no Brain in Payroll
The point is , if you were set my up with someone, I'd like to think you set me up with someone like him
I think Brain's a little out of you league
Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsurt, go with the Burgundy
Could we see somthign in a slimmer heel
I have nothing in the evenign shoe in the burgundy, I will show you something in the silver that might work
Unless we go with a different dress
Is everything all right ,dear?
Some days it's all I can think about
I can't find my bearings
Paolo sent them from Italy
Monika, ready to go?
don't we look nice all dressed up
It's stuff like that, isn't it?
I think it might be time for you to start using night cream
Check it out
YOu are a frightening, frightening man
I hope they're not ruined
Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost
Having my worst fear realized 
I'm just checking to see if the muscles's in a spasm
You missed a belt loop
I took these when I had my golfing accident
I have no idea who Dorophy is 
look who is up
how do you feel 
What do you got there
just hearing disbility  
three minuntes to go in the third
could you maybe hand me a cracker
You grandmother would hated this
what with it being her funeral and all
No, I'be hearing about why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham
how she drove you crazy
more wine, dear
No, I'm depressed 
Can we be grown-ups now?        
Oh that's Nana right there, in the middle
Let's see
Me and the gang at Java Joe's
How old was she there
So I can spend thanksgiving with my family
I've sort of started this whole independent thing
Only ninety eight, fifty to go 
And this from the Cry for help Department
Are you wearing make-up
As of today, I'm officially Joey Tribiny, Actor/Model
What were you modeling for ?
You know those posters for City Free Clinic?
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps
You know they are not actually supposed
Chandler you're still boycotting all the Pilgrim holidays
Why don't we invite her?
and probably want to bring her lesbian life partner
I just came by to pick up skull
and I have to get it back to Museum
You guys are sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian
You know you have to take a course 
otherwise they don't let you do it
I just think I should get some belly time too
Not that I believe any of this
I'd very much to butter you head
you can just put it on table
we chipped in
what is it with you this holiday
I have and I remember this part vividly
It's difficult to enjoy thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse
we used to work together
you are the Obsession girl, right?
I was the Aramis guy    
get out
you know when to spritz, when to lay bakc
I just remember I have to do something
Set another place for thanksgiving, my entire family thinks I have a VD
You know what
Five hours from now 
gonna get my stuff
Chandler, will you just come in, already? 
I prefer to keep a safe distance form all this merriment
coming pumpkin pie
we all laughed when you did it with stuffing
you've got a little piece of turkey on your fork
a little blackberry sauce on the tot
It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of MY disease
I thought we could have them whipped and add some peas of onions
Because then they'd just like the way my mom used to make it, you knwo, before she died 
The most unbelievable thing has happened
Underdog has gotten away
the balloon?
the actuall cartoon character
it's all over the news
Before he reach Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washing Square Park
I'm going the roof, who is with me?
I can't, I gotta go 
Any time you were ready
Where am I talking to here, well, there's one way that seems to offer certain acaustical advantage
just aim for the bump
all right, don't do it, it's fine 
I love The moment we first saw the giant dog shadows all over the Park
but did they have to shoot it down 
that was just mean
Do either of you have the keys?
I gotta get my ticket
That tone will not make me to go any faster
So, on a dare, I pick paleontonogy
because let's face it, you are fetus
You are just happy you don't have gills anymore
Look, you don't have to talk to it, you can sing to it if want to 
for an emergency just like this
It it wasn't you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this
aside from the fact you said you had them 
Isn't it enough that I'm making thanksgiving dinner for everyoine.
only dogs can hear you now
this doesn't smell like moms
But you wanted lumps, Ross?
It's nice to have someone
Shall I carve
by all means
who wants light cheese, who wants dark cheese
Does anybody wanna split this with me  
you guys have to make a wish
you got the bigger half
I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving all of you plan
I think it because it didn't invold divouce
So I guess what I'm trying to say
and here's to a lousy christmas and a crappy new year
There's somebody I'd like you to meet
That's would be Marcel
That monkey's got a Ross on its ass
Is he gonna live with you like in your apartment
I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is just kind of path
you guys. I'm doing all-new material tonight
I have 12 new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman
might want to open with snowman
Yoiu were Santa last year
It's not even jolly, It's all politicla
I'm gonna be one of his helpers
Do you guys know what you're doing ofr new yeasr
Nothing for you, you have Paolo  
you don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday
desperate scramble to find anything with you lips just so you can find someone to kiss when the ball drops
So I'll just as pathetic as the rest of you 
Just six of us, dinner
Oh Pheobe, you are on
Is it something that you'd like to share with the entire group
The guy's going home with a note 
Yeah, I liked her in Splash a lot , but not so much in Wall Street
I thought she had a hard quality 
Sit here, Marcel, sit here
I can't belive he hasn't kiss you yet
I mean, Got by my sixth day with Paolo, he'd already named both of my breasts
just a smidge
Did you ever see An officer and A Gentlemen
Yeah, because I already asked Janice.
I snapped
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm I snapped
He's playing with my spatulas again
look, he's not gonna hurt them, right
he throw some faces
I can look in on him for you 
Were you planning on kissing me ever?
That's definitely a valid question
we've reached a place where it's just gonna be on of those things where I just like sweep everyhing off the table and throw you down on it  
I mean, you're just a sweeper, trapped inside a physists' body
So, tell me something,   
There's no room for milk
There, now there is  
So on our no-day evening
Paolo's catching an earlier flight
what's elf to do?
I wanna stay here and makeout with my girlfriend
Getting so good at that
I love this artichoke thing
Don't tell me what's in it. The diet starts tomorrow
let me ask you something, If I showed up with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in you home
he was more embarrassed about that than anyone
And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happeded
What do you say, you and I do a little mingling 
I'll catch up with you later
Jerk misses his flight
and then your face exploded?
I was at the airport
something about how it was her cab first, she just starts pulling me out by my hair
And I hit my head on the curb
I'm not saying he has to spend the whole eveving withm y
hey Ross, take our picture
Smile, you are on Janice's Camera
I couldn't get a flight out till tomorrow
So at least I'll get to see him agian
I'm gonna blow this one up
will you give me the thing
It won't be the same, but I'll still be Mintsk
It's tearing me apart
and then you put your arms around me
and then the peacock bit me
and the moment of joy is upon us
just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news 
What was I hoping would happend. That he'd turn around and say I love that sound and I must have you now
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times.
I can't get on a plane without one
You wouldn't think it's cool if you're 11 years old and all your friend are passing about page 79 of mistress bitch
I think she is a blast 
So then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire
now why would she say that's embarrassing
So now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is it going? 
I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone
you know, don't take this wrong
Congress is debating a new deficit-reduction bill
The mayor wants to raise subway fares agains
He could be a Glen. Not not special enough
way too special
I'm famished, what do I want
only you could've picked this place
lost track of time
but a man can change
anyone want me to appraise anything ?  
and band, you have got yourself a book
any messages for romm 226
what is with you tonight?
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?
People will not turn 325 pages for a Paolo
Com'on, the guy's a secondary character
he's a complication you eventual kill off
Maybe a hot-looking aunt
Apparently, somebody overslept 
no, I don't. Because it's being restrung
well, you didn't call and leave your grip size
I'm scum, I'm scum
You don't think my mom's sexy
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribuani was a handsom woman in her day, alright/
Hey, what are you guying doing out here?
Do they wait for me to do this?
He's not even wearing a jock strap
just thought I'd drop this off
Do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning
Not even to change hisi pyjamas 
I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot of drink
and you know how he gets when he is drunk
Knowledge is a tricky thing
I spent the entire day with you. Why didn't you tell me?
You're luck I caught them when I did, or else who knows what would happend?
Thanks man, big help
You know, of all my firends, no one knows the crap I go throught wiht my mom more than you 
I'm still mad at you for not telling me 
I'm still on the first chapter
and here's a picture of my mother and father in their wedding dasy
I believe I was talking to Joey
there were two sets of lips
We're rehearsing a Greek play
you mena you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel
Still doing the play
and I get you the foot massager
I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends
just knowing you're gonna be there is enough
or somehting to that effect
the forbidden love of a man and his door
he told her off
when are you gonna grow up and start being a mom
Then she came back with
Are you sure she didn't say
Hard to tell, they are so tiny and upside down
maybe you cound scrape
and we're done with the yogurt
and so I did this as a favor
How come you don't live with Mommy
my sister's giving us her place for the weekend
first weekend away together 
Shouldn't it be flung by now?
We're way past the fling thing
I mean I'm feeling things that I've only read about in Daniel Stell books
When I'm with him 
Call Immigration?
Need a new table
and MOnica sends her love along with this lesgnma
Is it vegetarian? Because Suan doesn't need meat
I got the results of the amino today 
Yes, I'm having enough trouble with the imgage of you and Susan together
But when you throw in Tanya
see a guy who doesn't want to know stands right here
thanks for the books
all right, who should we call first?
let's just say the impression you made in the butter left a littl3 to the imagination
How about if we split it?
You think we're ready for something like that?
well, just it's a big commitment, what if one of us wnats to monve out 
So let me ask you something
Was Kip a bettern roommate than me?
here comes 
Boy Scouts could've camped under there
That's patio furniture
Kip would've liked the birds
Because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
So how does this work?
Gonna balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Who care, We'll eat at the sink
I need some milk
Should I not have told you
I just like it better before it was better
you could be on the Olympic "Standing there" team
Two on one
Now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving
That is either, "how could you?" or "enoumous breasts"
I still have five of theis so
I don't wanna look at other guys
Any cookies left
I just gotta figure out what I want 
Am I having a boy 
I'll only use my left hand
Tell them the story about your patient, who thinks thingks are the other htingks 
That's pretty much it
I mean mittens are nice
I wouldn't wanna be there when the laughter stops
It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues 
I just met you
How long are you in the city?
I got a job midtown
I figure I'm better off staying with the kid that hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry
quick, say something funny
I made the appointment with Dr. Bassada
No, It's only been six years.
You're burning your potatoes 
You're one to talk
Joey, You dad's in love, big time
And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
If you woke up one day, and found out your dad was leading this double ife 
Why can't parents just stay parents
We're all adults here 
Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail
All these years, I though you were on my side, but maybe what you were doing is sucking up to mom and dadx
which had the little lifeboat
If we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go
Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
It was great seeing you again 
But I'd go for a np
When you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting 
I shouldn't have come
I don't want you to take that thing this late
We'll go to a hotel
and I don't care how old you are as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rule
Comon, I'll show you to my room
either you break if off with Ronni
I can't sleep in my underwear
about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls
about how I'm always going out with all these women
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to a stand-up and go the distance
you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business
fasten your seat belt
it's time to see your thing
Why didn't you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right
There's chicken in there, put it away
Hold on, you know/
You should heard some of this covered stories
I'm sleeping over at my accountant's
He's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive
he's been more loving
It's like everyday's our annivesary
So you talked to your dad huh  
because he got a restraining order
which has nothing to do with anything except I found out today
I'll end up like mom
what happende
Telling your Ross, she wants you. 
She lent me an egg once. 
I don't think we need a third 
Can we get an egg over here, still in the shell?
She'll love it!
Think it'll work?
because he's creepy, and mean, and a little frightening
Phonbe, you can go out with the creepy guy any night of the year
what are you guys doing tomorrow night 
Nonono, don't dare bail on me?
You have not been out with a woman since Janic, you'are doing this
She's checking her coat
Joey, I'm gonna wash the cab smell off my hands
Okay, I'm making a break for it and going out of the window
You set me up with a woman I've dumped twice in the last five months
I can't go when I'm nervous
I'd take a little crying any day over Howward
That's why I can't wear a digital watch
The woman is voluntarily bald
It's valentine's day, It's perfect
I cut you our of all my pictures
Really, because you know you could make little puppets out of the  , you can use them in you theatre of cruelty
Tell me it's you and me "we"
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.
But I definitely want to be a  part of it  
Although I have enjoyed the fact that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper ever since your came back fro mthe bathroom
I've always wanted to know
Rach, come to see who's out here?
This is like an ununion in the hall
there is someone I want you to say hi to
he just happened to call
That's right, it's me?
You mean, they're lovers?
If you wanna put a lable on it?
OH, and she's pregnant with my baby
we need the sermen of a righteous man
Can we start throwing things in 
and I have the receipt from my dinner with
Oh man, in my next life, I'm comming back as a toilet brush
I thought you said they can shoot the spot without you
These people will scooch down
you guys will scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching, come on?
Carol teach sixth grade
wasn't even a hard marjor
A piece of silk boxer shorts, greeting cards
That guy is hairer that the chief
you're our third call tonight
Sure, Valentine's our busiest night of the year
well then you ask yourself this
Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn
It's not true
Her coat is gone
or Maybe it's cold in there
That could be is
This is still pretty hot
some women might even stay through dinner
Let's just stick a pin in i
but there's something right here
you'll find someone
That's easy for you to say, you find one already
you'll be set
I'll even let you right the bell
are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm gonna tell htem 
May I say that is a very flattering sleeve length for you
If this is about those prank memos
never mind. it was gonna be really good
It's a typical day at work, and I'm inputting my numbers
So was it a lot of money? 
 one of those guys that's in his office untill 12:00 at night worrying about Wenes
I know and I thought of you first
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant
What kind of food is he looking for 
So anyway
Does anyone know a good date place in the neighborhood
If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free
Does anyone know a good place if you're not dating a puma
He's curator of insects at the museum
I'd introduce her to my monkey   
she's gonna take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal
Soothing tones
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down
I just always pictured myself doing somehting 
I had a grade about five hours ago
What we say, ten dollars an hour
This night has to go this perfect
and I've sort of been maintaining my amature status so taht I can waitress in the Olympics
I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at InnsBruck in 76'
A wired thing happened to me on the train this mornign
we ended up cuddling
Shut up, it was nice
I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this 
I wanna feel your hot soft skin with my lips
Hi chandler, while you are sleeping the guy from your old job called again
it's a lot less satisfying to steals pens from your own homes, you kn
that's very generous
check this out
Thank you. Hello. That'll be all
When you ran out on your wedding , I was there for you 
I put a roof over your head
hello, greeter girl
Would you like to tour
I was just being polite, but alright
In the cab on the way over
I think we're ready for our first course
These are rock shrimp ravioli
cilantro
just a touch of minced ginger
Smack my ass and call me Jdudy, These are fantastic
That's all there're of these
Word has lost all meaning
They are like a little corn envolope 
You can just wait another six and a half minutes
Wjy don't you just have a seat hear
Hey, fellas, grab onto a sugar-o, save yourselves
it's just that I've waited for 7 years for an opportunity like this, you can't even wait four and a half minuntes for a stupid onion tartlet  
You know all those yummy noises, I wasn't faking
It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard
At one point, there were villagers
You know , by hte time we finished with all the tak
he keeps erasing messages on my machine
when you and I talk to each other about 
The woman who cuts my hair
Not from where I was standing
It's mostly just dumb sister stuff
like everyone always thought of her as the pretty one
even though I did it later that same day 
but to my parents, by then it was like 
I've got earth science, but I'll catch you in gym
we've got dads, the whole parenting team
isn't that gonna be weired?
Susan and I live together
I was just going to have your data here

you might wanna run it by uh ... 
it's true, we're one egg, once
in some parent-teacher thing
we're gonna start with some basic third-stage breathing exercise
why don't you get on your back
I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coatch training just because I'm a woman
I'll flip you for it
The annual net usage statistics are in 
but I slept funny and my hair was very very 
Bath salts would be nice
look, you're cold and I have to pee and there's a cup of coffee on the window
how bad it could be 
I think we have an answer
That would be God's way of telling to eat at home
Think she got fired at iffs 
I'm gonna wait till after we order , it's her, right?
So, so you're here too?
much as you are
your turn
we know what we want 
you don't have to knock anymore
I can hear it thought the ceiling, my cats can't sleep
Can you do me a favour
I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade
Didn't I memo you one htis?
If you ask her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired
The sound of mom and dad will never forget
lights please

That's all, everything will be the same
it'll just stay n
No one is gonna up to you and saying, HI, is that your nostril, Mind if we push this pot roastt thourhgt

How could you say that, I can't even get Marcel stop eating Bathmat
Well, not that it's any of you business

If you he knew how you felt

Have you either of your guys ever been to the Rainbow room

Aren't you a little cute to be doctor

The very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes
It's like returning to the scene of the crime

come on, she'll be here any minute
I tell you one ting, I wouldn't mind having a piece of sun-dried-tomato bussiness
Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune
because there's time to make up for that
and they brought you in, and then gave you to  me

His father tried to put you out of business
Maybe he can switch it back
Hold on a second, let me just check and see if she's here
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office
We forgot to sign one of the admissions form

Your sister stood me up the other night
Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you ?

No food with a face, remember?
YOu just called a little while ago about need a signature on the admissions form
It turns out we need a whole new one
I'm just gonna pay for this with a check

Say all of his relationships are affected by this
Whose turn is it
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY
YOu go get the animal out of here
If it was ,would you stop hanging out iwth he r
YOu have never looked so beautiful
if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for
sick of the lousy tips sick of being called excused me
did you proofread this
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be impressed with you excellent compuper skills
Do you think it's on all of them
I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few 
Your visa bill is huge
Is this still about her whole The flintstones could really happen thigng 
It's just, I want someone who does something form e, you know, who  gets my heart pounding
Read them and weep
Well, now
I wouldn't need any, because I have a straight
high stakes, big bucks
Pheobe just threw away two Jacks because they didn't look happy
last minute lesson
I see, so then, you are lying
about how goods your cards were
Is is not another word for lying?
Sorry to break up this party, but I'll get the resume to fax before work tomorrow
YOu see, king Georgy is giving us the land
You owe us the money for the game
Why dont' we forget abou htem

in order for me to win
becuase once those cards are dealt
All right boys, let' eat
Did you get that the 'I love rachel' pizzeria

You believe what a jerk Ross was being
I was gesturing and plates slipped out of my hand
It's liek the mother ship is calling you home
I would be shopping for a living 
because I think I hit him with my car
nice earings
I am parked at a meter

So Pheobe owes 7.50
This way I can break'em up with a moview
I have to win money to exert my power over women
and we will take every last time you have 
kind of stepped on my point 
That way, we don't have to go thourhgt the formality of actually playing
we'll see who has the last laugh there, money boy  
The one-eyed Jack follows me wherever I go
I'm still waiting to hear from the job , and the store closes at 9:00, so you can eat tham
just have a Tic Tac to hold me over
You guys, you know what I just realized?
Well, you better hop out of the shower
Hop back in bucko, I got four sixes
I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile
I made you look
MOnika, in or out?
veins poping out of you temple
plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants  
first of all, I'm not losing
but you know
THis is gonna be lots of other stuff
I just lost the job and I'd like to raise the bet 5 bucks
were you just full of it?
how many you want/
and monika gets me purse
That's a tough hand to beat
I thought we had them
When you don't have the dcard, you don't have the cards, you know 
the unbearable lightness of being
where else would we get any
country club newsletter
my mother sends me the engagement notices for inspiration
she's pretty luck to have had a friend like you 
I hsoud be happy for them
I guess it would be difference if I were with somebody
penis embargo
You know with Paolo, that's all. There was, was heat

I don't need to seee Lou Grant frolicking
I've gotta go
You're gonna to spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you 
Does Aunt Monika get a say in this?
I can not believe we're even having this discussion
I'm like, in disbelife
I'm don't you think if htings were gonna happend with Rachel, they would've happend already
She spent all day taking care of my monkey
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine
you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used 
We're glad she'd dying
Are you playign with MOnika's shoes
Did you poo in the shoe
I'm sure you didn't register for that
those little clunky AMish things, you think go with everything
Why is air in here so negative
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time
You're loose in the city
it's his first time out, he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things
we start with the building
you guy take the first and second floort, 
Does anybody wanna trade
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
saw Regies Philbin once
and pickles on the side      
how did it go today
great, it went great
let's not drink it her  
but before we head off to the murder capital of the northesat
quick and painful
I shouldn't have asked you  to start off with a monkey, I should've start you off with like a pen or a pencil
who is it?, animal contorl
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal
I'm not allowed to have him in the city
because I don't exptect you're gonna invite them to the apartment

It turned  out it was a hat
Is that who  the monkey's named after
Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is punishable by up to two years in prion and confiscation of the animal
you remember how we talked about saying thing quietyly to yourself fitst
but there isn't always time
I'm sure there's some friendly ways to reconcile this
first of all, we haven't been intorduced 
I sat behind you guy in the homeroom
YOu have no idea who I am, do you
would it have been so hard to say
or 'nice overalls'
you were fat, you had your own prbomems
be that as it may 
you think you just help us out here on that monkey thing, just for the oldt imte's sake
taste this darquiri,
is there too much rum here
we may not know anything about radiators per se
weren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
So if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out?
from now on ,  vYou don't get to talk to other pieple  
something just brushed up against my right leg
this is ridiculous, we've been all over the neighborhood
he doesn't know the Village
Now , I have a broken fooot
Now that you kicked the sign, I don't miss marcel any more
It's not like I did this on purpose
things just sort of happen aournd you 
you're off in rachel land
totally oblivious to people's monekys, or to people's feelings
I dont' even want to hear it
then what's with all the bananas
all right, I want my monkey
You had to be a bitch in the high school, you couldn't have been fat
I was the homecoming queue and the class president 
how about I call your supervisor and I tell her taht you shoot my firend inthe ass wit hthe dark
It'll be nice to get this finally, won't it?
We can leave it on for now, that's fine
I'm sorry I was so hard on you before
are you in the mood for
The neighbors must be vaccuuming
I was thinking about
I think I am still in love wit hyou
we have got to start locking htat door
This is me in the Sound of Msuic
That's because I'm in front of them
I went to boarding school with 400 hundred boys
my butt cheek is waking up
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut and Mr. salty
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts
there's some creep out there with a telescope
school children will study it as one of the greatest, first dates of all time
we didn't have to play any games
So have you called her yet
Let her know I like her , what are you syaing 
It's the next day, how needy do I wanna seem
stop being so testosterony
I got her machine, her answering machine
Basically, that'a how 
Take me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room
I had that chicke, hwere you poken it and all the butter squits out
we never actually got to that
That's nice twice
Is anything wrong with taht
It was so nice having this little sink here
I wasn't expecting the machine
Hey, I've been honing
What was with the dishes
I might have some kind of like, like I haven't been sitting around here for the last two hours
he's waving back
this morning, I caught him looking into our apart\
I feel like I can't do stuff
Will you grow up ?
this was not good
way better than menduy
If you want, I'll just break if off with ehr 
Thanks Bernes
Lest go away this weekend   
I t hink we're starting to see some real progress here
But for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as hphone 
You don't that makes me seem a little
You obviously saw my personal ad
now I'm needy and snubbed
I miss just being needy 
how come you have dental floss in your hair
we ended up having sex in his chair
I said that a little too loud, didn't I 
I want you on this couch
If it helps, I can slide over 
I have things with my life
I'm late for keeping up with it
see you tomorrow
She want to see me tomorrow
I figured that's where you'd be 
I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out 
What else is it about
oh, hold up. I'll walk out with you     
were you wearing any kind of uniform
why don't you just take it with yo u 
We haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
We should really be sitting for this
she's all bitter that she losts her weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face
Is that all you wanted to ask me?
What would make you think that?
He's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel
hey, you know our phone's not working
just pointing out he irony
the number for a Sydney Marks, please
hearing device, radiator, 
I lvie across the street
If I wanna walk aound my apartment in my underwere
that's not really the point
I'm an idiot. I am weak. I couldn't help myself
Whatever I did, I only did because I love yourself
even when we were having sex in that chair
Doing htat secnd time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup
first time didn't really count, you monw, it was berry
start over again
Dr, Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here
ever since I ran out on Barry in the wedding, I wondered whether I made the right choise 
I've been calling you, but it turns out you had your number wring
How could someone get a hold of you credicard number
but look how much they spent
the credit card people said you only have to pay ofr the stuff you bought
I think when somebody steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind
It's just a phase
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious
She buys clothes at stories that I'm intimidated by salespeople
my agent thinks I shoudl ahve a name that's more neutral
you're kind of losing it here
for the love of god , odn't do it
we're just here to observe 
spare your shoes over there
is there any body you think could be me
last time there were some empty yorgurt containers lying aound after class 
you can come up to front and dance with me 
Why don['t I take off my clothes and hving a nightmare]
Who's the new tense girl
I just got back from the vet 
she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she;
Hey, he beats you 
You just got him, how coould he be an adult alrfeady
well, we're applyin to a lo tof them 
But htat may just be a pipe dream, because you know it's out of state
My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility
NO, we took her to lunch
after you were with woman for like ten minutes, you forget all alike that
with this amazing spiritz, which probably she stole from some cheerleaders
No way did you do this
Monona was very brake
We told them that we were the Gunnerson
they threw us out
you ladies are no thte only ones livign the dream 
we're auditioning for a broadway show.
make complete fools of ourselves
